# README

## System dependencies

* Ruby 4.0.5 (see `.ruby-version`)
* PostgreSQL
* **libvips** — Active Storage resizes uploaded CMS images through it
  (`ActiveStorage.variant_processor` is `:vips`). Without it an upload succeeds
  but every variant URL 500s with `undefined method 'new' for nil`, because the
  `image_processing` gem is only a wrapper around the C library.

  ```sh
  brew install vips          # macOS
  apt-get install libvips    # Debian/Ubuntu
  ```

  The Dockerfile already installs it, so this is a local-setup step only.

## Everything else

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
